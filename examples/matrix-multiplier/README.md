## 🔬 Mathematical Insights

### Computational Complexity

Matrix multiplication demonstrates fundamental algorithmic complexity concepts:

```
Naive:     O(n³) - 2n³ floating-point operations
Strassen:  O(n^2.807) - Asymptotically superior for large n
Blocked:   O(n³) but with better cache performance
```

### Performance Metrics

**GFLOPS Calculation**:
```rust
GFLOPS = (2 * n³) / (time_seconds * 10⁹)
```

Where `2 * n³` represents the total floating-point operations (multiply + add for each element).

### Memory Hierarchy Optimization

**Cache-Blocked Algorithm**:
- Divides computation into blocks fitting in CPU cache
- Improves spatial and temporal locality
- Reduces memory bandwidth requirements

**Parallel Efficiency**:
```
Speedup = T_sequential / T_parallel
Efficiency = Speedup / Number_of_Threads
```
